Try and find conditions under which accidents are more frequent in order to better inform city residents and first-responders

- Many columns in weather dataset are sparse and not immediateky useful for deeper analysis
- However temperature is almost always defined
- From eyeballing temperature bucket vs accident count query results, look like there is a relationship
- Plot % of times weather bucket is recorded vs % of times accident is recorded in weather bucket
- Looks like relationship but unclear
- Create a lift chart and see significant results in warmer temperatures
- Break it down by accident type and see massive spike in hot weather (also lift curve)

Broke it down by borough bc different boroughs appear to have different demographics and availability of public transportation, parking, home garages etc. 

- Review plots and lift curves
- Highlight outliers
- Recall sparsity but still evaluate: in particular bike deaths have a huge uptick and especially in Brooklyn

Looked at contributing factors in accidents of interest:
- Mainly not recorded or empty, but when recorded, driver inattention
- Particularly in Brooklyn there was a surprising number of "failed to yield" bike related accidents

- Then tried to see where in particular in Brooklyn there were bike accidents and whether the locations varied over time
- Bridge entrances and near Prospect Park: high traffic and also close to densely populated residential areas
